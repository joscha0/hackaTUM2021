## Inspiration
Connection within communities, Access to high quality food sources, Reduce climate impact of food delivery.

## What it does
UPlant empowers Individuals and communities to plant their own food and make their City greener. Our Step by Step guides make farming and gardening accessible. Our Projects- designed for collaboration- connect individuals locally to build a community. A Help side dedicated for tutoring further promotes the closeness within the community, by not only being helped, but also knowing who helped and seeing and thanking them personally.

## How we built it
We built the app using Flutter, for a platform independent usage. And used Firebase in the backend to coordinate all the data. For safety reasons we don't use any personal information.

## Challenges we ran into
Azure had no Flutter plugin and Flutter wasn't able to connect to the database, therefore we had to build a REST API using Azure and python but ran into problems with a request to get the data into the app. In the end we decided to use Firebase as an alternative due to the expiring time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In a small team of 2, with little knowledge , we manged to build a solid concept and implement it nearly completely in less than 36 hours.

## What we learned
Basic Azure functionalities, Flutter basics, SQL-Server handling.

## What's next for Urban Gardening
To expand and remain local, UPlant has to categorize users and their contents to their zip code.
